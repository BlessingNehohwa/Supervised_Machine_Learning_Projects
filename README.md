### 1. Regression- Target Transformations
This is a regression analysis on the Boston dataset whereby i wanted to see if target transformations has any effect to the outcome accuracy of the regression model. I used a variety of transformation functions so as to see the best transformation that can get our dataset normally distributed.
- Apply transformations to make target variable more normally distributed for regression
- Apply inverse transformations to be able to use these in a regression context
